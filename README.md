# react-native-template
Boilerplate template for react-native

# Description
The purpose of this template is to establish the common architecture, testing patterns, and deployment infrastructure for a react-native project.

# Tech Stack
This project uses Expo to manage the build configuration between react-native and the native platforms. Expo offers a better developer experience by abstracting away the native build tools and providing a single interface to build, test, and deploy the application. This project also uses the following libraries:

- XState: State Machine library for managing the bootstrap, and infrastructure of the application, such as push notifications, authentication, and navigation.
- React Navigation: Navigation library for managing the navigation of the application.
- Notifee for push notifications
- React Native Testing Library: Testing library for testing react-native components.
- Jest: Testing framework for testing javascript code.
- Detox: End-to-end testing framework for testing the application on a device.
- React Native Firebase: Firebase library for managing push notifications, analytics, and crash reporting.
- React Native Permissions: Library for managing permissions on the device.
- Fastlane: Library for managing the deployment of the application to the app store.
- React Native Async Storage: Library for managing the storage of data on the device.
- UI Kitten: UI library for react-native.
- Tanstack Query: Library for managing the api cache
